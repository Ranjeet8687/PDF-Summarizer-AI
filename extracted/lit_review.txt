        - Summarize Key Findings - Extract and summarize relevant insights from each reference, ensuring that similar studies are grouped logically.
        - Cite Properly - Use IEEE citation format, e.g., "Handwriting digit recognition has been extensively studied using neural networks [1]."
        - Maintain Logical Flow - Organize the literature review into a coherent structure, categorizing related studies.
        - Use Formal Language - Ensure the text aligns with academic writing standards and maintains objectivity.
        - Avoid Direct Copying - Rewrite and paraphrase information in a scholarly manner.
        Example Input:
        [1] Abu Ghosh, M.M., & Maghari, A.Y. (2017). A Comparative Study on Handwriting Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks. *IEEE*.  
        [2] Alizadeh, S., & Fazel, A. (2017). Convolutional Neural Networks for Facial Expression Recognition. *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*. Cornell University Library.
        Expected Output:
        
        Handwriting digit recognition has been widely explored using neural networks. Abu Ghosh and Maghari [1] conducted a comparative analysis of different neural network architectures, demonstrating that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperform traditional multilayer perceptron models in terms of accuracy and robustness. Their study highlights the importance of feature extraction and layer depth in achieving high classification performance.

        Similarly, CNNs have also been applied to facial expression recognition. Alizadeh and Fazel [2] proposed a deep learning approach that utilizes convolutional layers to automatically extract features from facial images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Their work underscores the effectiveness of deep networks in recognizing complex patterns in visual data.

        By leveraging CNNs, both studies demonstrate the adaptability of deep learning in computer vision applications, reinforcing the need for optimized architectures tailored to specific recognition tasks.
