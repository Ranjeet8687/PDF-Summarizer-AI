                "text": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of deep learning, especially in processing grid-like data structures such as images [1]. Their effectiveness in tasks like image classification [2, 3], object detection [4, 5], semantic segmentation [6, 7] and image generation [8] stem from their ability to effectively learn spatial features. Convolutional layers, using filters or kernels, capture local patterns and extract features from input images. One important feature of convolutional layers is the shared weights implemented by kernels. This allows for efficient deep learning on images, as using only fully connected layers for such tasks would result in unfathomable numbers of parameters. Pooling layers, like max pooling and average pooling, reduce the spatial dimensions of these features, helping the network to focus on the most significant aspects.\n\nDespite their popularity, CNNs face challenges in computational efficiency and adaptability. There have been several convolutional neural network architectures that have been proposed that are aimed at efficiency. Some of such architectures include MobileNet [12] and EfficientNet [13]. However, such traditional CNNs, with fixed architectures and number of parameters, may not perform uniformly across different types of input data with varying levels of complexity.\n\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS), a method for selecting optimal neural network architectures, has been a response to this challenge. NAS aims to obtain the best model for a specific task under certain constraints [14]. However, NAS is often resource-intensive due to the need to train multiple candidate models. in order to determine the optimal architecture. It is estimated that the carbon emission produced when using NAS to train a transformer model can amount to five times the lifetime carbon emissions of an average car [15]. This highlights the importance of finding suitable\n\narchitectures for neural networks, yet also points to the limitations of current approaches in terms of static structure and proneness to over-parameterization.\n\nSelf Expanding Neural Networks (SENN), introduced in [9], offer a promising direction. Inspired by neurogenesis, SENN dynamically adds neurons and fully connected layers to the architecture during training using a natural expansion score (defined in section 2.1) as a criteria to guide this process. This helps overcome the problem of over-parametrization. However, its application has been limited to multilayer perceptrons, with extensions to more practical architectures like CNNs identified as a future research prospect.\n\nOur study aims to develop a Self Expanding Convolutional Neural Network (SECNN), building on the concept of SENN and applying it to modern vision tasks. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no research on Self Expanding CNNs, despite the potential they hold for addressing model efficiency and adaptability in vision tasks. Unlike existing approaches that often require restarting training after modifications or rely on preset mechanisms for expansion, our approach utilizes the natural expansion score for dynamic and optimal model expansion. This research represents a significant step in developing adaptable, efficient CNN models for a variety of vision-related tasks.\n\nThe contributions of this research are as follows:\n\n- Developing a Self Expanding CNN that dynamically determines the optimal model size based on the task, thereby enhancing efficiency.\n- Eliminating the need to train multiple CNN models of varying sizes by allowing for the extraction of checkpoints at diverse complexity levels.\n- Eliminating the need to restart the training process after expanding the CNN model.",
